      "description": "TRELLIS is a large 3D asset generation model. It takes in text or image prompts and generates high-quality 3D assets in various formats, such as Radiance Fields, 3D Gaussians, and meshes. The cornerstone of TRELLIS is a unified Structured LATent (SLAT) representation that allows decoding to different output formats and Rectified Flow Transformers tailored for SLAT as the powerful backbones. This version of TRELLIS implements half-precision. Works on NVIDIA GPUs.",
